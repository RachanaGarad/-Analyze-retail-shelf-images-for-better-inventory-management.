Introduction
This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify retail shelf images into three categories: "empty shelves," "items in order," and "misplaced items." Our aim was to improve inventory control, optimize shelf display, and enhance operational effectiveness in retail environments. The success of this project can help address common retail challenges like product shortages and mismanaged displays, thereby increasing sales and customer satisfaction.

Technologies Used
Dataiku: Data science platform used for managing data workflows and deploying models.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Employed for image classification tasks.

Results
The model achieved an initial performance accuracy with a precision score of 0.421. Our analysis showed:
Improved classification of retail shelf images.
Insights into the causes of product shortages and disorganized shelves.
Graphs and matrices illustrating model performance and classification accuracy over multiple test epochs.
